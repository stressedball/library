Make Library Project

Make HTML page as follows :
- left part for displaying saved books
- right part for displaying user form

Left part :
Make table. Each row displays a book.

Right part :
Will allow user to register and add a book to the collection
- a rectangular shape
- 5 inputs max : Name of book, author, status...
- submit button

Make CSS.

Make JS :
- add event listener to the submit button
- when clicked, code will take details of book (which should be an object)
then add it to the HTML (going to have to figure out how to make a table
dynamically)

Make event listeners for every input
Make object constructor AddBook
Pass input values to object contructor

Make JS write to HTML

Think I got this.
